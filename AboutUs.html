          <p>  Established in 1964, Hotel Sri Velmurugan has since become a historical landmark in the neighbourhood. Initially, the Propreitor Mr. Ramachandran seeing the lack of a good restaurant in the area, decided to open up a restaurant catering to the needs of the local populace serving hot and delicious vegetarian meals for cheap. In 1980s, restaurants in Ooty were a budding industry and Hotel Sri Velmurugan was one of the earliest and only quality restaurants in the area. Our early patrons included labourers who were participating in the export of carrots and potatoes from Ooty who required early morning refreshments before they had to go to work.
